# cms
This is code for a custom CMS using PHP and MySql that I made for graphic designer Matthew Gaynor's website http://www.emspace.net/. Using his wireframes, I used the JQuery gallerific and cutom scrollbar plugins and developed a simple admin area where he could upload, name and delete his projects and also update his about and contact info. I used the tinyMCE text editor for the about and contact sections. 

I've omitted Matthews images and logo and included some default images for the download. I've also included the database file.
